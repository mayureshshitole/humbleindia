        I work with clients to help them identify patterns in their behavior which cause problems, put them in a perspective and then facilitate unlearning them.
    
        By engaging with you, by attempting to enlighten that sensitive part of your personality that you have suppressed, I can make you conscious of what it will take for you to be happy. You cannot change the world but that one small change that you bring about in your attitude can sometimes help change your entire life.
        
        My goal is to empower you to choose how to respond to your environment judiciously instead of being a victim to it. `,
